# About me

Hi, my name is Marcelo Hansen, I live in Portugal :portugal:. I'm in career transition to the Data Analysis field. Currently I study at [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) and [Hashtag Treinamentos](https://www.hashtagtreinamentos.com/).

### Experience

In my career I have a background of 17 years in transport engineering, both in public and private sector companies. Among my activities, I highlight engineering planning and projects, data analysis, contracts and team management.

From 2018 to 2021, I was Technical Director at the Public Transport and Circulation Company (EPTC) of Porto Alegre/Brazil. In that position, I led the team in the creation of the ["Observatório de Mobilidade"](https://eptctransparente.com.br/observamobilidade) (Mobility Observatory), based on Data Warehouse concepts and tools like GIS, Power BI and Python to develop and publish maps, dashboards and reports.

Previously, for 4 years, I worked with computer maintenance, installation of networks, softwares and operating systems.
